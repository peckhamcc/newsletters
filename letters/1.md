Welcome to our first ever newsletter!  More than a few people have mentioned that they find the WhatsApp group a bit hectic (ahem, <mute>), then express surprise when they've missed out on a group ride or a kit order, so this should hopefully be a low-frequency, noise-free way to get up to date on all PCC happenings.

# What's in this newsletter?

1. Mallorca roundup
1. Christmas Party
1. 2018 AGM
1. Upcoming Sportives

## 1. Mallorca roundup
Our biggest ever club trip took place at the beginning of November - 13 riders headed off to the Balearic island of Mallorca to squeeze a last bit of riding in short sleeves out of 2018 (despite the locals telling us we were crazy to be going out in bib shorts in 18 degrees).

Eric had a few 50km rides planned (mostly back to back) and found a kindred long-distance spirit in Jonathan - the rest of us mere mortals tackled Mallorca's iconic rides, including Sa Calobra, Coll de sa Batalla, Puig Major and the Cap de Formentor.

Massive thanks to Rob for doing all the organising and getting us there & back safely.  We'll hopefully do another trip somewhere warm in the spring so watch this space.

## 2. Christmas Party
The 2018 Christmas party will take place on Friday 21st December at [The Old Nun's Head](https://www.theoldnunshead.co.uk/)!  Tickets are £10 and include a Secret Santa lucky dip.  But wait, there's more!  Making a return from last year's party - our very own roller-racing game, this year it'll be four riders at a time!

[Tickets are available now](https://ti.to/pcc/christmas-party-2018).

## 3. 2018 AGM
Ok, so technically the 2018 AGM was in March, but we want to give everyone enough time to plan an amazing 2019 so we're going to hold an AGM in December.

### We need your help

The AGM is your chance to get involved in running the club - you can stand for election as Chair, Treasurer or Secretary, but we also badly need volunteers to help out with social media, organising events, charity fundraising, etc which is a low-impact way to help out and make a difference - [please use this form if you'd like to stand for election or volunteer](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf1wylHqjxzcTwjsQessAtLovLkKDAcOvAN5c6K_Sk4zu4DuA/viewform).

### Let us know how we're doing

We have a [feedback form for input from club members](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdAum7KSIO4QTh-HgEvlbSjHdMUdAtBpzxuTNFQgtDWHBhlXQ/viewform) that we will keep open until the end of the month - please take five minutes to fill it out, it's important and will inform the agenda for the AGM.

Ok, where is it?
The AGM itself will be held from 7pm on Wednesday 5th December, upstairs at:

[The Clock House](http://clockhousepub.com/)
196A Peckham Rye
London
SE22 9QA

If you can't make the date, don't worry - we will put the items to be voted on up online before the meeting so your voice will be heard.

## 4. Upcoming Sportives
Our traditional season opener [The Hell of the Ashdown](http://www.hellgb.co.uk/) is on Sunday 17th February 2019. It's a 107km/1800m ride around Ashdown Forest and the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and generally serves well to remind us not to eat so many mince pies at Christmas. You can get a train to Bromley South which is near the start, or there will be a group riding to and from Peckham making it around 100 miles for the day.

Entry is £30 and includes several food stops and a timing chip.  We'll be doing a group booking later in the week to ensure we get the same start time, please transfer £30 to the club account with the reference NAME-HOTA (e.g. JOHN-SMITH-HOTA) if you'd like to take part.

That's all, folks!
