## Raid Alpine 2020

In 2020 Peckham Cycle Club will be tacking the Raid Alpine - an 750km ride from Thonon on the shores of Lake Geneva to Nice on the Côte d’Azur, taking in some of the most iconic alpine climbs, many of which regularly feature in the Tour de France.

The riding will be split up into two chunks of three days with a rest day in the middle.  The plan is for the rest day to coincide with a high-alpine Tour stage, but to do this we will need to book the rest day accommodation as soon as the route is announced in mid-October as they sell out quickly.

The final dates also depend on the Tour being announced, but they are likely to pass through the alps early-mid July.

We're hoping to bring the cost for this in at around £650pp based on 8 nights B&B style accommodation with two adults sharing each room. Single room supplements will be available.  The payment schedule will be a £100 non-refundable deposit due by the start of October to secure your place and allow us to book the rest day accommodation.  Further payments will be requested in the new year and the final cost will depend on future exchange rates.

Logistics and will depend on how popular the ride is - a support driver will be possible with enough riders, otherwise we'll be packing light and porting our own luggage.

## UCI Worlds trip

PCC are going to West Yorkshire over the weekend of 27-29th September to watch the UCI Road World Championships. The fastest men & women in the world will compete for the right to wear the famous striped jersey for a year.  No, not our summer jersey, the UCI Road World Champion's jersey.

Any outstanding payments for this trip are due by September 10th.

## GoAhead London feedback

Having been approached by the Acting Assistant Operating Manager for Go-Ahead London (who provide nearly a quarter of London's buses) Jemma, Gerard and Nick went along to a meeting about bus and cycling safety at the New Cross bus depot. We didn't really know what we were going to but it turned out to just be a small meeting with the three of us the Operating Manager and a bus driver. Their drive (pun intended) for the meeting was the TFL wide Vision Zero project which aims to eliminate all deaths and serious injuries from London's transport network by 2041.

We had a free flowing, wide ranging discussion about the dangers we face when riding, issues bus drivers have with cyclists, possible additional safety measures, the need for more education on road safety including cycling proficiency in schools and how cyclists and the bus operators could work more together as allies in creating a safer, greener city. All in all it was a really encouraging and positive meeting - they certainly appreciated our input and the bus driver said she found it particularly enlightening and helpful to see things from our perspective. it was also interesting that most of our gripes, particularly with the infrastructure of roads and cycle lanes, are shared with bus drivers, so we are certainly allies when it comes to pushing for an improved system.

We very much encouraged them to get in touch again if we can help by talking to larger groups of drivers or input more into the Vision Zero project, so we may have further opportunity to engage. It was a great thing to do as part of our responsibility as a local community group and hopefully we can do more with them.
