## Raid Alpine 2020

In 2020 Peckham Cycle Club will be tacking the Raid Alpine - an 750km ride from Thonon on the shores of Lake Geneva to Nice on the Côte d’Azur, taking in some of the most iconic alpine climbs, many of which regularly feature in the Tour de France.

The ridling will be split up into two chunks of three days with a rest day in the middle.  The plan is for the rest day to coincide with a high-alpine Tour stage, but to do this we will need to book the rest day accomodation as soon as the route is announced in mid-October as they sell out quickly.

The final dates also depend on the Tour being announced, but they are likely to pass through the alps early-mid July.

We're hoping to bring the cost for this in at around £650pp based on 8 nights B&B style accomodation with two adults sharing each room. Single room supliments will be available.  The payment schedule will be a £100 non-refundable deposit due by the start of October to secure your place and allow us to book the rest day accomodation.  Further payments will be requested in the new year and the final cost will depend on future exchange rates.

Logistics and will depend on how popular the ride is - a support driver will be possible with enough riders, otherwise we'll be packing light and porting our own luggage.

We've booked the velodrome in Herne Hill 5-7pm on the 12th October for a private track taster session.  £15-£25pp depending on final numbers and includes coaching & bike hire.  You can bring your own pedals & shoes, spanners for changing them over are available.

The session covers getting used to starting and stopping and riding on the banking on a fixed gear bike, a few group riding exercises to make sure everyone is safe/confident riding close to others and finally one or two mock taster races.
