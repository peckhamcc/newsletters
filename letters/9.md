## Go Ahead London feedback

The Mayor of London has a scheme to elimiate all road fatalities and serious injuries by 2041 - as part of Go Ahead London (the people who run the bus network) are gathering feedback on how to improve road safety for cyclists.

If you'd like to take part, they are hosting us at the New Cross bus depot from 18:30 this Thursday (22nd August).  If you can't make it but would like us to pass on your feedback, please get in touch.

## Congratulations

Club members have taken on some massive challenges this summer, here are a few highlights:

### Ride 100

Well done to everyone who took part in the Ride 100 this year, we had a whole range of riders supporting different charities and we also gave away some club places won in the ballot.

Extra special thanks to Erica Chambers who coordinated a PCC-exclusive refuling station in Dorking and well done to those who donated to Harefield Hospital in thanks for her support.

### Marmotte Granfondo Alpes

One of the hardest one-day sportives at 174km/5000m the Marmotte Granfondo Alpes looms large in many a cycling calendar.  This year Chris Durham & Colin Tonks tackled it without hesitation, climbing the Glandon, Télégraphe, Galibier and finishing on the 21 hairpins of Alpe d’Huez.  Chapeau!

### l'Etape du Tour

Because Chris couldn't get enough of riding in the Alps, he, Stef Ruis & James Russell completed l'Etape Du Tour in the high mountains on a punishing 135km route from Albertville to Val Thorens, completing more climbs than the pros did on the same route that made up stage 20 of the 2019 Tour de France.

### Raid Pyrénéen

At the end of July, club members Alex & Katherine Potsides embarked on the Cyclo Club Béarnais' Raid Pyrénéen - an unsupported ride across the Pyrenees from Cerbere in Pays Catalan on the Mediterranean coast to Hendaye in the French Basque Country on the Atlantic.

The route has been ridden since the 1950s - it's about 800km with some 18,000m of ascent and takes in 28 cols including famous climbs from the Tour de France such as the Col du Torumalet, the Col d'Aubisque and the Col de Peyresourde.  They tackled it in two three-day sections, with a break in the very picturesque Bagnères-de-Luchon, home of the second oldest ski resort in France after Chamonix.

The ride took them through national parks, across rivers and over mountain passes, but always to a good meal and a comfortable bed in the evening.  It was hard going while Europe was in the grip of a heatwave, but the views and the descents more than made up for it!

Next year there are plans afoot to tackle the Raid Alpine with the club - a ride from Lake Geneva to the Mediterranean coast of a similar distance/altitude, watch this space for further details!
